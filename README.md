# HybridBranchNet

HybridBranchNet is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture that was proposed in a research paper in 2023.
The main idea behind HybridBranchNet is to optimize
the design of CNNs in terms of depth, width,
and resolution based on a branch neural network


 The code for this article will soon be made available on the corresponding GitHub repository.
